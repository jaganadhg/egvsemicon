# Eigenvector Metal Etch Data Parser - Python

The Eigenvector Etch Data Parse is developed to read Matlab data files. The parse reads each file and converts the calibration data (sensor data) and test data (sensor data) into a single DataFrame. The parse introduced an additional field in the data 'fault_name', which helps the user identify the normal/calibration wafers and test wafers(with defects). We tested the parser in Python3 environments only; if you are looking for Python2 compatibility, please test and create a bug/pull request as applicable. The source code is released under Apache 2.0 license and is available at https://github.com/jaganadhg/egvsemicon.
